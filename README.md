# About

Small demo project to test new Terragrunt features and practices.

A stack in Terragrunt is a collection of related units that can be managed together. Stacks provide a way to:
- Deploy multiple infrastructure components with a single command
- Manage dependencies between units automatically
- Control the blast radius of changes
- Organize infrastructure into logical groups
